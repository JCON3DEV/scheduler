# Interview Scheduler

A scheduler app that allows you to choose a time and day for an appointment with an instructor. You can edit your details or cancel an existing interview.
The remaining slots for the chosen day are displayed and update according to any changes in bookings.
This uses React, Webpack, Axios as well as Storybook, Jest, Testing Library and Cypress for testing.
